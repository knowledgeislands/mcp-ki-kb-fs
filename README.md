[![CI](https://github.com/knowledgeislands/mcp-kb-fs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/knowledgeislands/mcp-kb-fs/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@knowledgeislands/mcp-kb-fs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knowledgeislands/mcp-kb-fs) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude read and write access to a local knowledge-base directory. Every file path is validated against the configured root, so the server cannot read or write outside it — even if asked to.

## Features

- **Read-only-by-default tools** — list and read are flagged as read-only and idempotent via MCP tool annotations.
- **Path safety in two layers** — lexical normalisation (rejects `..` and absolute-style escapes) plus a `realpath` check (rejects symlinks pointing outside the root).
- **Protected paths** — dotfiles/dotdirs at any depth (`.git`, `.obsidian`, …) and root-level repo-meta (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSE`, …) stay hidden from ordinary tools; a separate exact allow-list permits read-only access to selected repository context files.
- **One content surface** — the same read, list, write, rename, and delete tools handle Markdown notes and side files; Markdown frontmatter/body selection remains available when reading `.md` files.
- **No network, no auth** — pure local filesystem over MCP stdio.

**Quality:** 236 tests at 100% coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines.

## Available Tools

Tools follow the convention `<app>_<resource>_<action>`. Each tool declares an annotation preset (`READ_ONLY`, `WRITE`, `WRITE_IDEMPOTENT`, `DESTRUCTIVE`) which determines its access level (`read`, `write`, or `destructive`) via the underlying MCP hints (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint`). The registered surface is controlled by the `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ACCESS_LEVEL` env var (defaults to `read`; levels nest). Tools above the configured level are silently skipped at registration.

| Tool               | Level         | Preset             | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `kb_config`        | `read`        | `READ_ONLY`        | Return resolved zones and root-file read allow-list. |
| `kb_read`          | `read`        | `READ_ONLY`        | Read text, binary, or a Markdown slice. †            |
| `kb_list`          | `read`        | `READ_ONLY`        | List files, folders, or Markdown notes.              |
| `kb_rename`        | `write`       | `WRITE`            | Rename/move a file. Refuses to overwrite. ‡          |
| `kb_folder_create` | `write`       | `WRITE_IDEMPOTENT` | Create a folder; idempotent. §                       |
| `kb_write`         | `destructive` | `DESTRUCTIVE`      | Write or overwrite text or binary content. ¶         |
| `kb_delete`        | `destructive` | `DESTRUCTIVE`      | Delete a file. `dry_run` defaults to `true`. ‖       |

† Zone/staging-root paths are readable; exact `root_file_allowlist` entries are also readable, but never writable or listable. Markdown accepts `part: "all" | "frontmatter" | "body"`. ‡ Non-idempotent: a second call with the same source fails because it has moved. § Succeeds when the folder already exists. ¶ Accepts UTF-8 or base64 and optionally creates parents; `dry_run` defaults to `true`. ‖ Pass `dry_run: false` to actually unlink.

### `kb_read`

```json
{
  "name": "kb_read",
  "arguments": { "path": "Pillars/Finance/Budget.md", "part": "body" }
}
```

Returns JSON with the file path, MIME type, encoding, byte size, and content. UTF-8 files return text; binary files return base64. `part` is valid only for UTF-8 Markdown.

`kb_read` accepts ordinary files below a declared zone or staging root, plus exact configured context paths. The default root-file allow-list is `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`.

Configure a different exact list in the KB root’s `.ki-config.toml`:

```toml
[knowledgeislands-kb]
root_file_allowlist = ["README.md", "AGENTS.md", "CLAUDE.md", ".github/copilot-instructions.md"]
```

Every entry must be a non-empty KB-relative path with forward slashes; absolute paths, traversal segments, backslashes, and empty path segments are rejected at startup.

### `kb_list`

```json
{
  "name": "kb_list",
  "arguments": { "path": "Pillars", "kind": "notes", "recursive": true }
}
```

`path` must be a declared zone or staging-root directory. `kind` is `files` (default), `folders`, or `notes`; `ext` is available only with `kind: "files"`. The KB root and root-file allow-list are never listable.

### `kb_write`

```json
{
  "name": "kb_write",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "Inbox/2026-04-30.md",
    "content": "# Notes\n\n- ...",
    "create_dirs": true
  }
}
```

`encoding` is `utf-8` (default) or `base64`. `create_dirs` and `dry_run` default to `true`. The operation is limited to declared zones and staging roots.

### `kb_rename`

```json
{
  "name": "kb_rename",
  "arguments": {
    "from": "Inbox/draft.md",
    "to": "Pillars/Finance/Budget.md",
    "create_dirs": true
  }
}
```

Non-destructive: refuses to overwrite an existing destination. Both paths must be within declared zones or staging roots and pass the standard root/protected guards.

### `kb_folder_create`

```json
{
  "name": "kb_folder_create",
  "arguments": { "path": "Pillars/Finance/2026" }
}
```

`mkdir -p` semantics: creates intermediate folders as needed and is idempotent (re-running succeeds with `Folder already exists: "<path>"`). Fails with `Path exists as a file, not a folder` if a regular file already occupies the path. No `dry_run` — it's non-destructive.

### `kb_delete`

```json
{
  "name": "kb_delete",
  "arguments": { "path": "Inbox/2026-04-30.md", "dry_run": false }
}
```

`dry_run` defaults to `true`; pass `dry_run: false` to actually unlink. Root-file allow-list entries are never deletable.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**: `bun install`
2. **Pick a knowledge base directory** — any folder of notes and side files (can be empty).
3. **Build**: `bun run build`
4. **Configure Claude Desktop** with the path to `dist/mcp-server/index.js` and your `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
5. **Restart Claude Desktop** — the enabled `kb_*` tools should appear (defaults to read-only).

## Example Conversations

Concrete asks you might make of Claude with this server connected.

**Survey a section of the KB:**

> "List every note under `Pillars/Finance`, recursively."

Claude calls [`kb_list`](#kb_list) with `path: "Pillars/Finance", kind: "notes", recursive: true` and returns the KB-relative Markdown paths. Folders are excluded.

**Read a specific note:**

> "Show me my Budget.md note from `Pillars/Finance`."

Claude calls [`kb_read`](#kb_read) with the KB-relative path. It can return the full file or the Markdown body/frontmatter; traversal and protected paths are rejected unless the path is an exact read-only root-file allow-list entry.

**Capture meeting notes:**

> "Save these notes as today's daily under `Inbox/2026-05-13.md` — create the Inbox folder if it doesn't exist yet."

Claude calls [`kb_write`](#kb_write) with UTF-8 Markdown content and `create_dirs: true` (the default). The path goes through both the lexical and `realpath` safety checks before any byte is written. `kb_write` is annotated `DESTRUCTIVE` (it can overwrite an existing file), so `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ACCESS_LEVEL=destructive` is required for it to register.

**Discover structure:**

> "What top-level folders exist in my knowledge base?"

Claude calls [`kb_list`](#kb_list) with `path: "Pillars", kind: "folders", recursive: false`. The root itself is deliberately not listable.

## Installation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Name                               | Required | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH`           | yes      | Absolute path or `~/...` to the knowledge base root. The server asserts on startup. |
| `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ACCESS_LEVEL`        | no       | Maximum tool access level to register. †                                            |
| `MCP_KI_KB_FS_AUDIT_LOG`           | no       | Audit-log scope. ‡                                                                  |
| `MCP_KI_KB_FS_AUDIT_LOG_PATH`      | no       | Path to the JSONL audit log. Default `~/.local/state/mcp-kb-fs/audit.jsonl`.        |
| `MCP_KI_KB_FS_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES` | no       | Size-based rotation threshold in bytes. ¶                                           |
| `MCP_KI_KB_FS_AUDIT_LOG_KEEP`      | no       | Number of rotated audit-log files to retain. Default `5`.                           |
| `NODE_ENV`                         | no       | Dev convention; controls which `.env` files `loadConfig()` picks up. §              |

† Maximum tool access level to register. One of: `read` (default — read-only tools only, least privilege), `write` (adds non-destructive mutations: `kb_rename`, `kb_folder_create`), `destructive` (adds overwrite/delete: `kb_write`, `kb_delete`). Levels nest. Each tool's level is derived from its MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint: true` → `read`; `destructiveHint: true` → `destructive`; explicit `readOnlyHint: false` AND `destructiveHint: false` → `write`; missing annotations → `destructive` fail-safe); a tool registers when its derived level ≤ the configured level. The `dry_run: true` default on destructive tools controls _effect_; this gate controls _visibility_. An unknown value aborts startup.

‡ Audit-log scope. One of `off`, `writes` (default — record only non-read tool calls), `all` (record every invocation).

¶ Size-based rotation threshold in bytes. Default `10485760` (10 MiB). Set to `0` to disable rotation.

§ Dev convention. `loadConfig()` in [`src/config/index.ts`](./src/config/index.ts) hydrates `process.env`, from the package root and highest precedence first, from `.env.local`, then `.env.${NODE_ENV}` (when set), then `.env`; a var already in the environment (e.g. the MCP client's `env` block) always wins. `ki:server:mcp:dev`/`ki:server:mcp:inspect` set this to `development` so `.env.development` is picked up; under Claude Desktop it is unset, so only `.env.local`/`.env` would apply.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Run `bun run build` first so `dist/mcp-server/index.js` exists, then add to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-kb-fs": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-kb-fs/dist/mcp-server/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH": "/path/to/your/kb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A starter is in [`claude-config-sample.json`](./claude-config-sample.json).

### Running From Source (Dev)

For fast iteration without rebuilding:

```bash
MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH=~/notes bun run ki:server:mcp:dev
```

This runs `src/mcp-server/index.ts` under `bun --watch`. Point Claude Desktop at this command during development if you want live reload.

Alternatively, copy [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to `.env.development` (or `.env.local`) and set `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH` there. At startup `loadConfig()` in [`src/config/index.ts`](./src/config/index.ts) hydrates `process.env` from the package root, highest precedence first: `.env.local`, then `.env.${NODE_ENV}` (when set), then `.env`. The `ki:server:mcp:dev`/`ki:server:mcp:inspect` scripts run with `NODE_ENV=development`, so `.env.development` is picked up; Claude Desktop does not set `NODE_ENV`, so only `.env.local`/`.env` would apply. A var already present in the environment (e.g. the Desktop config `env` block) always beats any file.

## Development

```bash
bun run ki:server:mcp:dev      # bun --watch mode (NODE_ENV=development)
bun run ki:server:mcp:start    # build then run from dist/ under node
bun run ki:server:mcp:inspect  # MCP Inspector against TS source (NODE_ENV=development)
bun run test                # vitest (use `bun run test`, not `bun test`)
bun run ki:lint:types          # tsc --noEmit
bun run ki:lint:check          # Biome lint + format check
bun run ki:lint:fix            # Biome auto-fix (uses --unsafe)
bun run ki:lint:md             # prettier + markdownlint for *.md
```

## Security Model

- The root is resolved at startup from `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH` by `loadConfig()` into `config.rootPath`, then threaded into every tool. `~` is expanded to the user home directory.
- Every tool input goes through two checks before any FS access:
  1. **Lexical** — `resolveWithinRoot()` normalises separators, strips leading slashes, then asserts the resolved absolute path is strictly inside the root. Inputs that resolve outside via `..` or absolute-style paths are rejected with `Path escapes root: "<input>"`.
  2. **Physical** — `assertRealPathWithinRoot()` calls `fs.realpath` on both the root and the target (or its deepest existing ancestor for new-file writes) and verifies the realpath of the target lives inside the realpath of the root. This rejects symlink-based escapes that the lexical check cannot see.
- **Protected paths** are filtered out of list tools and rejected by read/write tools with `Path is protected: "<path>"`. Two rules:
  - any path segment beginning with `.` is protected at any depth (covers `.git`, `.obsidian`, `.env`, etc.);
  - root-level basenames `README`, `CLAUDE`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `AGENTS` (case-insensitive, with optional `.md`/`.txt`) are protected so the KB folder's own repo-meta isn't exposed. Nested files with the same names (e.g. `archive/README.md`) remain accessible.
- **Root-file exception** — `kb_read` is read-only and permits no discovery outside declared zones. After the normal lexical and physical root checks, it reads only an exact `root_file_allowlist` entry from `.ki-config.toml`; defaults are `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. This narrowly permits repository context and named agent instructions without exposing other root files or dot-directories.
- **Content discipline** — `kb_read` returns base64 for non-UTF-8 content and accepts Markdown `part` selection only for UTF-8 `.md` files. `kb_list` distinguishes files, folders, and Markdown notes while retaining the same zone and protected-path rules.
- The server has no network access and performs no authentication. Trust is delegated entirely to the local OS user running it.

```

## Troubleshooting

**`MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH environment variable must be set`**

The server aborts at startup if `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH` is missing. Set it in the Claude Desktop config `env` block, or as a shell variable for `bun run ki:server:mcp:dev`.

**`MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH not accessible: <path>`**

`MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH` was set but the path doesn't exist or isn't readable. Verify the path, and check that `~` was expanded as you expected (the server expands a leading `~/` itself).

**Tool returns `Path escapes root`**

The requested path resolves outside the root, either lexically (`..`/absolute) or via a symlink whose target sits outside `MCP_KI_KB_FS_ROOT_PATH`. Use KB-relative paths and check any symlinks inside the KB.

**Tool returns `Path is protected`**

The path matches a protected pattern (a dotfile/dotdir at any depth, or a root-level repo-meta basename like `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md`). These paths are intentionally not exposed by the MCP. If you need a meta-named note, place it below the root (e.g. `archive/README.md`).

**`part` is rejected by `kb_read`**

`part: "frontmatter"` and `part: "body"` are available only for UTF-8 `.md` files. Use `part: "all"` for every other file type.

**Cannot find module after pulling changes**

```bash
bun install
```

## Extending the Server

Add a new tool by registering it in [`src/tools/kb/index.ts`](./src/tools/kb/index.ts) (or a new group under `src/tools/`) via `server.registerTool(...)`, and put the implementation in a matching `src/main/` module that takes `Config` as its first argument. Follow the existing pattern:

1. Validate inputs with a strict zod schema (`.strict()` to reject extras).
2. Set MCP annotations honestly (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) — the access-level gate derives the tool's tier from these.
3. Run any path inputs through `resolveWithinRoot(cfg.rootPath, ...)` (and `assertRealPathWithinRoot` for FS-touching tools) before touching the filesystem.
4. Return errors via `errorResult(...)` so the client sees `isError: true`.

The tool layer stays thin — validate args, call a `src/main/` function with `cfg`, map the result to an MCP envelope. The generic content logic lives in [`src/main/files/index.ts`](./src/main/files/index.ts), with Markdown-specific helpers retained in [`src/main/notes/index.ts`](./src/main/notes/index.ts).
