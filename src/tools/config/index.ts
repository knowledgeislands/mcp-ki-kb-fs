staging area names, the root-file read allow-list, and the raw .ki-config.toml content.

Use this as an orientation step when working with an unfamiliar KB — it tells
you which top-level folders correspond to each canonical zone (Calendar, Pillars,
Resources, Streams, Admin) and which staging areas (+/ and -/) are configured.

The zone map is derived from .ki-config.toml at server startup; if the file is
absent, all zones use their canonical defaults.

Takes no parameters. Returns a JSON object with:
- zones: { Calendar, Pillars, Resources, Streams, Admin }
- staging: { inbound, outbound }
- rootFileAllowlist (exact paths available through kb_read)
- kiConfigPresent (boolean)
- kiConfigRaw (string — raw TOML or "(absent — all zones are defaults)")`,

      annotations: READ_ONLY
